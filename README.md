# UnityProceduralStochasticTexturingNode
Procedural stochastic texturing node for Unity's Shader Graph, to fix repeated tile patterns on tiled textures.  

**For terrain: https://github.com/JuniorDjjr/Unity-Procedural-Stochastic-Texture-Terrain-Shader**  

Just use this file as a custom function node for Shader Graph. Color and normal/bump versions map are separated.
